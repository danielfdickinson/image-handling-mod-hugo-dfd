## Frontmatter images

Based on the following frontmatter, there should be two. The second one is loaded from a remote source (<https://istockphoto.com>). The static image is ignored because static images are only processed if no resource images are found.

The displayed images from frontmatter should be full width to a maximum of screen width.

See [README.mdâ€”Featured images](../README.md#featured-images)
