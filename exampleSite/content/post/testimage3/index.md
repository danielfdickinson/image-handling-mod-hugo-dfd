{{< figure class="responsive-div" imagewrapper="div" title="Figure 1: Differences between markdown figures and figure shortcode" src="cappy-on-bed.jpeg" alt="Yorkshire Terrier Poodle cross (dog) curled up on a duvet and looking towards camera" caption="For a figure caption can be different than alt text">}}

## Via figure shortcode (originalheight):

{{< figure class="responsive-figure-originalheight" singlesize=true title="Figure 1: Differences between markdown figures and figure shortcode (original height)" src="cappy-on-bed.jpeg" alt="Yorkshire Terrier Poodle cross (dog) curled up on a duvet and looking towards camera (no caption specified so alt as caption)">}}

## Via figure shortcode (fullwidth):

{{< figure class="responsive-figure fullwidth" title="Figure 1: Differences between markdown figures and figure shortcode (full width)" src="cappy-on-bed.jpeg" alt="Yorkshire Terrier Poodle cross (dog) curled up on a duvet and looking towards camera (no caption specified so alt as caption)">}}
