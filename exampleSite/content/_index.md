**NOTE**: This site isn't meant to look pretty, it's meant to show the behaviours
of the image handling module and various CSS. It is best used by also reading the
source code at <https://github.com/danielfdickinson/image-handling-mod-hugo-dfd/tree/main/exampleSite>, or [the documentation](post/readme)
