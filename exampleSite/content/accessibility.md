## Statement

[Daniel F. Dickinson](https://wildtechgarden.ca/about/) makes his best effort to keep this site accessible and inclusive. If you find something that does not meet that goal, please use the [contact form on his main site](https://wildtechgarden.ca/contact/) to let him know.

## Goals

Over time the intent is move the images (at least) on this site to a 'Universal Design' principle instead of using well-meant tools that create different experiences for users facing barriers versus those who are not. For example: 'alt' tags often contain information that would be of interest to a sighted user if written well, and by the same token are often not written well because of the 'out of sight, out of mind' effect. As such, good captions create a better experience for all compared to 'alt' tags.

Obviously there is a lot of work to do on this site, in that respect.

A more difficult challenge is to use language that is less complex, while saying everything I want to say. That is a longer term project.
