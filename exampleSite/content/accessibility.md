## Statement

[Daniel F. Dickinson](https://www.danielfdickinson.ca/about) makes his best effort to keep this site accessible and inclusive. If you find something that does not meet that goal, please use the [contact form on his main site](https://www.danielfdickinson.ca/accessibility#contact-form) to let him know.

## Goals

Over time the intent is move the images (at least) on this site to a 'Universal Design' principle instead of using well-meant tools that create different experiences for users facing barriers versus those who are not[^1].

Obviously there is a lot of work to do on this site, in that respect.

A more difficult challenge is to use language that is less complex, while saying everything I want to say. That is a longer term project.

## Navigation Notes

[We never open links in new tabs, use "Open link in new tab" if you want that](https://www.danielfdickinson.ca/post/accessible-design-no-blank/). ([#dontbreakthebackbutton](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=dontbreakthebackbutton))

[^1]: For example: 'alt' tags often contain information that would be of interest to a sighted user if written well, and by the same token are often not written well because of the 'out of site, out of mind' effect. As such, good captions create a better experience for all compared to 'alt' tags.
